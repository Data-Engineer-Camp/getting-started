# Git 

Git is a version control system which will help us keep track of the different versions of our code. 

To install git, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and select "Download" for your Operating System. 

Once the installation is complete, you can go into terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows) and type `git --version` which should return `git version 2.36.1` or similar.
