# Intro presentation 

Great work on installing the software pre-work! 

On the first day, we will be asking everyone to present a 1 minute presentation about themselves. 

Please prepare up to 3 slides on any of the following points: 
- Where you work and your role 
- Interesting facts about yourself 
- Favourite hobbies or sports 
- Anything under the sun 

We encourage you to include photos and keep it fun! 

Check out a sample intro presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KGSesJoyvl1FqJQTwp1BRd4xpTkL2aeIezWZFFAC-Q4/edit?usp=sharing).
