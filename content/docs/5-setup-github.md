# GitHub

GitHub is a cloud hosted git repository. Essentially it allows us to store our code on the cloud and it also enables team collaboration on the code.

For this bootcamp, you will need to create a GitHub account in order to:

- Access the code for this bootcamp
- Creating your personal portfolio
- Collaborating on project code with your teammates

To create a GitHub account go to https://github.com/ and select "Sign Up"

<b> Important! </b>

After creating a GitHub account, please provide your GitHub username to this [form](https://forms.gle/6nSese3fUtjfqBer6).

To get your GitHub username:

1. In the top right corner of GitHub (after you have signed in), select "Your profile"
2. In the address bar, you should see `github.com/your_username_should_appear_here`.
3. Copy the username value and submit via the form.

We'll periodically check the github usernames and add grant new usernames access to the github repository. So please give up to 2 business days for this to take place. 

You will receive an email from Github once you have been granted access.
